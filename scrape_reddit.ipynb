No? Noone does that?\nIt's fucking infuriating! I have gotten a lot better at recognizing the bullshit though.\nunless it's one of those pages where the first click, no matter where on the page, will always open a new tab of ad. After that, the 2nd click will work... assuming you picked the right button\n#adblock\nJust click and drag it. If it doesn't follow your cursor, it's an ad.\n\nedit: it works in most cases, not always\nThere are so many ways to tell which to click. Look at the status bar. Hover cursor and look for bubble pop-up text. Right click, copy link location, paste into address bar but don't hit enter. Use a virtual machine. Use a friends PC. Use grandma's PC. Don't be a dumbass kids.\nCnet_download_manager.exe\nLet me recount the time my step-mother clicked countless of these buttons, trying to follow her \"hacker-friend's\" instructions to generate a windows key.  Also, as a note, I sure as hell didn't want to do this. Unfortunately, she and my father didn't want me to buy my own Windows key like a sane, normal person.\n  \nShe was supposed to turn off my antivirus, and click three things, and then follow a few steps.  \n  \nInstead, she clicked every download button and every link on every website, opened several dozen Mozilla Firefox tabs, installed a dangerously idiotic amount of programs, until I finally told her to get up and step away from the desk.  \n  \nBy the time she was finished, the mouse barely worked, it took ten minutes to load most webpages, and after turning on Avast and covering my ears for a few minutes, she had racked up an impressive *five-thousand and twenty-seven infected files*. Malware, spyware, adware, trojans, viruses of all sizes and shapes, my PC could have been used as a hub, a carrier for every sort of malicious anything ever.  \n  \nI don't know how someone does that. But she did it. *It happened.*\nThe worst is when it's not even the first button. You got to hope for one in the middle, mouse-over it and hope it doesn't get too excited.\nHold and drag. Fake buttons will drag their image with them, the true button will drag the link.\n[deleted]\n[deleted]\nClick the 'Download Magnet' button.\nAdblock plus has been getting some hate lately but this is exactly what it puts an end to.\nIf you pray to Lord add block then there is but one choice \nI always choose the wrong one\nCouchtuner & putlocker for those who need sites and haven't seen these\nThe one with the Batman symbol\n*watch as free user* ~ click\nIt's a lie! The real link is always plain text!\ncopy the hash\nRound one, top center.  No arrow.  Tis the true button.\nublock.\n\nYou'll thank me.\n\nAlso, for mobile, firefox for android and install add on ublock.\n\nWorks great.\nor the button is not even there and it's a timer, every button is false\nClick and drag. The one without any transparent background is the real one.\nThe real button won't move if you drag it. So if it moves, it's an ad.\nTHIS is one of the key reasons it is still not possible for someone to be nailed for 'illegal downloading'.\n\nLove it.\nI only see one button, Adblock must be working\nSo literally sourceforge\n[deleted]\nI did this test separately with my mom and older sister when I installed software on their computer. \"Okay, this is a test. Which download button would you click, the giant green one or the little grey one?\" [They both failed.](http://i.imgur.com/m08y3Ke.jpg)\nit's probably the \"download\" button.\nYou know what would be a good movie to pirate? Ice Age: The Meltdown\nHold and drag. Fake buttons will drag their image with them, the true button will drag the link.\nAdblock\nEvery time i show someone how to use torrent sites \nwhy is this not Indiana Jones?\n[Relevant](https://xkcd.com/272/)\nyou clicked... poorly.\nThe magnet, choose the magnet\nTHEY'RE ALL DOWNVOTES\nHahaha. I have an unfair advantage. I've been playing this game since before the false buttons. \nadblock!\nLet's be honest though, the correct button is probably hidden underneath those buttons. \nIt requires an IQ over 45 to determine which one.\nthe real one isnt even a button. it's just plain blue text.\nTwo words: magnet links.\nIt's an old button...it hasn't been used in months because nobody finds it...It's a button someone made to hide his film...a button to access the treasure...I should go for the smal grey button...not the big green one...\n\nDamnit !! Forex commercial....\nSlacker Bobby and the Last Torrent\nadblock\nThis is why I run adblock.  Only one button, the true button shows for me. \nI look forward to the day that nobody gets this joke because we all know better. \nJust find the torrent hash or magnet link and copy it. Don't click *any* download links unless you're 100% sure it's the torrent file.\n/r/sad\nOnly the penitent man shall pass...\n\nThere! That's the download button of a carpenter.\nThe wrong button plays grindcore apparently\nIts always the least compressed image\nIts the button of a carpenter.\nNo, no, no no...
